# Dependency Inversion Principle

In the previous lecture we have seen how to use abstraction - and how to handle the dependency inversion principle. In this lecture, your task is to implement an application that can handle multiple payment methods - PayPal, Skrill and Payoneer as well.

Make sure that the high level module(s) do not depend on the low level implementations.

Good luck!
