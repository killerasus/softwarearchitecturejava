# Builder Pattern

## Exercise

In the previous lecture we have seen how to construct a Person object with the help of the builder pattern. In this exercise you have to construct the Student class in the exact same manner.

There are 2 compulsory variables (that the Student must specify):

    String name
    String university

There is a single variable that is optional (no need to specify):

    int age

Let's use the builder pattern to construct the Student class!

Good luck!
