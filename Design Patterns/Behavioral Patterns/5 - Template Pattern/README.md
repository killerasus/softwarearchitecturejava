# Template Pattern

## Exercise

In the previous lecture we have seen how to implement template pattern. In this exercise you have to define an abstract class - with the template pattern approach - for sport games.

There are 2 sports available: Football and Basketball.

There are 3 methods that are common in these classes:

    initializeGame() method

    playing() method

    showResults() method

Good luck!
