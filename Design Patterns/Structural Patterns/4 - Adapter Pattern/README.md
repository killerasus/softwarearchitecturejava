# Adapter Pattern

## Exercise

In the previous lecture we have seen how to work with different interfaces and behaviors with the help of adapter pattern. In this exercise you have to make sure we can handle XML files as well with CSVParser.

So we have the CSVParser supertype that can handle CSV files. We have RealEstateDataParser and MachineLearningDataParser classes that can parse CSV files - because we know that the datasource presents the data in CSV file format.

Then we have to parse stock market related data with a StackMarketDataParser class. The problem is that here we have to deal with XML format.

Solve the problem with the adapter pattern!

Good luck!
